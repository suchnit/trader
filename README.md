1. ADX (Average Directional Index) measures trend strength, not direction.
Below 20: trend is weak or sideways â†’ better to avoid signals (noise).
Above 20: indicates a meaningful trend (up or down).
Some traders use 25 as a stricter filter, but 20 is a common lower bound for detecting the beginning of a trend.

2. RSI < 30 (Buy) / > 70 (Sell)
Thresholds:
    Buy: RSI < 30 (oversold)
    Sell: RSI > 70 (overbought)
Why:
    RSI (Relative Strength Index) gauges momentum and reversal potential.
    <30: asset is likely oversold â†’ possible bounce.
        70: asset is overbought â†’ could correct.
ðŸŽ¯ Can tune to 35/65 or 25/75 for more or less sensitivity.

3. MACD Histogram > 0 (Buy) / < 0 (Sell)

Threshold: 0
Why:
    MACD Histogram shows momentum crossover:
            0 = bullish crossover (MACD line above signal)
        <0 = bearish crossover
    Crossing zero means change in momentum direction.
âœ… Use this to detect early trend reversals or momentum confirmation.

4. Price < Lower BB (Buy) / > Upper BB (Sell)

Threshold: Breaks Bollinger Bands
Why:
    Price outside Bollinger Bands = statistically rare move (2+ standard deviations).
    Below lower band â†’ potentially oversold dip â†’ mean reversion.
    Above upper band â†’ overbought spike â†’ mean reversion or correction.
âœ… Use this to catch extreme price action.
ðŸŽ¯ Works well in ranging markets, less in trending ones.

5. EMA20 > EMA50 (Buy) / EMA20 < EMA50 (Sell)

Threshold: Short EMA crossing over long
Why:
    Moving average crossovers are classic trend-following signals.
    EMA20 > EMA50 â†’ short-term bullish trend forming.
    EMA20 < EMA50 â†’ short-term bearish pressure.
âœ… This adds trend confirmation to other signals.

6. StochRSI < 20 (Buy) / > 80 (Sell)
Thresholds:
    <20 = Oversold
    80 = Overbought
Why:
    StochRSI is RSI of RSI â€” a faster oscillator for momentum extremes.
    More sensitive to turns than RSI â€” better for timing entries/exits.
    0â€“20 â†’ buy zone
    80â€“100 â†’ sell zone
âœ… Use this to sharpen entries after broader signals (like RSI or MACD).
